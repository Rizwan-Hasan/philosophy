      <description>Sometimes you have to take hard decisions. You may don’t want to take it and be upset about that. Don’t be upset. All the pain, upsetness you’re feeling is temporary. But this temporary pain can become a boost up for starting with a new strategy in long run. You need to leave something in order to get new. It may sound cruel but it’s the reality.</description>

      <description>People don’t want to spend alone moments. Most of the time when they get a feel of getting alone, they try to engage with things like listening to songs, watching movies, etc. Have you ever tried to observe the reason of this? A very simple reason they will give you that spending time without doing anything is boring. Yes, doing nothing is boring but this is not the right brick to fit in this puzzle.</description>
