      <description>Losers never give on giving excuses because they have a strong belief in themselves that they can’t do it. It’s your beliefs that make you the winner or loser in the first place.</description>

      <description>People don’t want to spend alone moments. Most of the time when they get a feel of getting alone, they try to engage with things like listening to songs, watching movies, etc. Have you ever tried to observe the reason of this? A very simple reason they will give you that spending time without doing anything is boring. Yes, doing nothing is boring but this is not the right brick to fit in this puzzle.</description>

      <description>People often misunderstand their desires and try to justify them with love. Just observe and see how desperate they are. Expecting love from them is foolishness because desire leads to desperateness where love creates flexibility.</description>

      <description>Not every time you need to give a conclusion with Yes or No. The same goes for expectation also. Yes and No are just a bunch of labels we believe. There&amp;rsquo;s also a state that exists between them, filled with countless happiness. If you can able to observe, just see; you&amp;rsquo;re getting it already or maybe much more than your expectation.</description>

      <title>Philosophy of People&#39;s Compliment</title>

      <description>You must not count every compliment you get. Most people don&amp;rsquo;t know how to give a compliment. If you observe well, you&amp;rsquo;ll see it&amp;rsquo;s just their normal way of talking to others. They&amp;rsquo;re just telling you that they can&amp;rsquo;t or they don&amp;rsquo;t want to do the thing that they are complementing on.</description>
