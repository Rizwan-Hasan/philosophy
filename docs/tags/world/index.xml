      <description>Not every time you need to give a conclusion with Yes or No. The same goes for expectation also. Yes and No are just a bunch of labels we believe. There&amp;rsquo;s also a state that exists between them, filled with countless happiness. If you can able to observe, just see; you&amp;rsquo;re getting it already or maybe much more than your expectation.</description>

      <description>The world has become a very strange place for good people. People don&amp;rsquo;t want to make compromises but expect from others by showing their kind of relationship label. It&amp;rsquo;s a very strange behavior of them and disrespectful also.</description>
