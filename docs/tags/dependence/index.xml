      <description>To become independent you’ve to learn how to become dependent. Because independency comes from dependency. Also, independence is not a constant thing. Everyone depends on another for something. Like if you hadn’t depended on your parents for those years maybe you won’t able to read these lines you’re reading now. Independence means shifting dependency according to the situation. If your way of dependent is flexible; congratulation; you’re independent now.</description>

      <description>Your parents are not your god. You’re the outcome of their love but believing them as god will be foolishness because God assigned them for you to give you a chance so that you can become an independent person. Independency comes from dependency. You’ve to be dependent on your parents for a certain time and at the same time have to figure out a way that best suits you to achieve independence.</description>
