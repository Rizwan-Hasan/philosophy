				<p>People don’t want to spend alone moments. Most of the time when they get a feel of getting alone, they try to engage with things like listening to songs, watching movies, etc. Have you ever tried to observe the reason of this? A very simple reason they will give you that spending time without doing anything is boring. Yes, doing nothing is boring but this is not the right brick to fit in this puzzle. Actually, they afraid of talking with themselves and they don’t want to think. Because thinking comes from questions. We think because we seek answers. They want answers too. But they’ve fear of getting proved wrong in their beliefs so much that they subconsciously chose the way of distraction for not getting alone. They just try to escape from problems and questions, instead of solving them.</p>
