To become independent you’ve to learn how to become dependent. Because independency comes from dependency. Also, independence is not a constant thing. Everyone depends on another for something. Like if you hadn’t depended on your parents for those years maybe you won’t able to read these lines you’re reading now. Independence means shifting dependency according to the situation. If your way of dependent is flexible; congratulation; you’re independent now.
