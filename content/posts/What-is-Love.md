Are you in love with someone? Have you ever comes up with the question of what is love? Ever asked your surrounding about it? Well, then most of the time you may find the same old repetitive answer in different words like a fast heart beating, feeling excited, doing crazy stuff to draw his/her attention, feeling shy in front. Yeah, that’s true and happens when you’re in front of that person. But it doesn't cover the whole story of what’s love is all about. Also, those aren’t mandatory, those are just an outcome of different chemical reactions happening inside your body. Then is it an attraction? Well yeah, suits better in terms of the majority. Regardless of its love or not, those aren’t permanent. So, we can’t take it as the answer to what’s love. Let me ask you some questions? Do you want to take that person’s responsibility? Do you trust him/her to a certain extend? Will you be with him/her as a shield in any circumstances life drags you in? Will you make fair and equal compromisation with him/her? If all of these questions answer is true from your side then yes it’s love. Love is all about responsibilities. If there’s everything but responsibility then it’s not love. True love will always make you calm and responsible.
