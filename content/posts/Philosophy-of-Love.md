Your first glance at her will drive you crazy. You're attracted by her and started to like her. But believe me, this is not love. Love will make you calm. Calmer than a jungle night. In love, her one glance will snatch you from the universe and end you up in a yonder hill. There won't be a sense of soil in your foot, you're floating, floating in a deep blue sky full of stars, your thoughts are going so deep that now you've lost the track of time, you're into her, her smile, her aura and suddenly a warm touch with a sweet voice of her will pull you up from the deep in back to the reality. Only you know how far you've traveled from and how calm you become after seeing her once.
