Your parents are not your god. You’re the outcome of their love but believing them as god will be foolishness because God assigned them for you to give you a chance so that you can become an independent person. Independency comes from dependency. You’ve to be dependent on your parents for a certain time and at the same time have to figure out a way that best suits you to achieve independence. And also they’re not giving you favor. It’s just their responsibility.
